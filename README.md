# asciiConverter
Class that takes an image and can convert it to ASCII chars or simply pixelate it to the amount you'd like.
It will ask the image you'd like to convert and the size of the pixelation or ASCII conversion.
If you want it pixel for pixel you can enter 1. For faster run times or a different result you may choose a higher integer.

I left my main class in the code for testing and demonstration purposes but the class is fully capable outside of my main function.
